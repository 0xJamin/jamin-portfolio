          software engineer deeply interested in bridging
          connections between developers and state-of-the-art technology. I
          write <a href="/blog">technical articles</a> and manage <a
            href="/works#communities">developer-communities</a

          Presently,
          I’m learning GoLang <Image src={go} alt="Go Icon" class="goLang" /> and I’m surprised at its inherent simplicity and
          remarkable performance as a programming language. As you must have
          possibly guessed, this portfolio is still a WIP. 🚧
